# UK-Police-Data
This project analyzes UK Police Data from September 2022 in the counties of West Yorkshire &amp; Durham.
The produced visualizations look at crime proportions by area as well as crime types proportions by area. Also, I added two maps which reflect on which areas have the most crimes recorded.
